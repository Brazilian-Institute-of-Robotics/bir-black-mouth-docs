We demonstrate the need to model the actuators and the power source of the robot system carefully in order to obtain experimentally valid models for simulation and analysis. We describe a new, simple running controller that requires minimal task level feedback, yet achieves reliable and fast running up to 1.2 m/s. These results contribute to the increasing evidence that apparently complex dynamically dexterous tasks may be controlled via simple control laws. In addition, the simple mechanical design of our robot may be used as a template for the control of higher degree of freedom quadrupeds. An energetics analysis reveals a highly efficient system with a specific resistance of 0.32 when based on mechanical power dissipation and of 1.0 when based on total electrical power dissipation.},

We consider a sprawling-type quadruped robot is practical, because of its high stability which comes from the large supporting leg polygon and the low center of gravity. However in previous researches, the speed and the energy efficiency of a sprawling-type quadruped robot is lower than a mammal-type quadruped robot. Since cost of transport (COT) can be reduced by increase of walking velocity, we decided to design a fast walking sprawling-type quadruped robot. As a demonstrator, we developed the sprawling-type quadruped robot named TITAN-XIII. For a lightweight and compact leg, the right-angle type wire driven mechanism is adopted to the robot. To confirm its performance, several experiments were carried out and the robot walked at 1.38 m/s and COT of 1.76 was achieved. Finally, we compared the performance of TITAN-XIII with other quadruped robots, and confirm that its performance is almost same level as mammal-type quadruped robots.},

In this paper, the concept of the feasible force set is introduced, and the ability of the foot end during the supporting period is quantified, considering the different configurations at different joint angles and physical constraints of the legs.

In this paper, we focus on the scenario where a quadruped robot travelling on the rough terrains containing forbidden areas, and a free gait generation method for quadruped robot is proposed. Under the assumption that a set of the positions which can be selected as the foothold is given, the quadruped robot can select the swing foot sequence and choose the best foothold for the swing foot automatically. A body sway motion is included into the motion planning of the free gait to enlarge the stability margin of the robot. With the aid of the sway motion, the stability margin of the robot is no less than the minimum stability margin during the whole walking process. In order to guarantee the locomotion continuity of the quadruped robot, a COG trajectory which has continuous velocity and acceleration profiles is automatically generated. Moreover, the locomotion speed of the robot is improved by ensuring the kinematic margin of the selected swing foot to be zero just before this foot lift-off the ground. With the free gait generation method proposed in this paper, the robot can autonomously navigate through rough terrains as soon as possible on the condition that the robot has enough stability margin. The simulation results show the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed method. 2015, The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

In each leg, there exists a designed swing phase virtual model control and a stance phase counterparts. In the whole body, virtual model control is utilized to achieve a attitude control containing roll, pitch and yaw. In the attitude control, a forces/torques distribution method between two stance legs is pre-investigated.

Secondly, an anti-disturbance control, which contains compensating gravity, adjusting step length, adjusting swing trajectory, adjusting attitude, and adjusting virtual forces/torques, is investigated to improve the robustness, terrain adaptability, and dynamic balance performance of quadrupedal locomotion. Thirdly, a trajectory tracking control method based on an intuitive velocity control is addressed through considering four factors: terrain complexity index, curvature radius of given trajectory, distance to terminal, and maximum velocity of quadruped robots.

The forces and torque acting at the CoM of the robot torso in the plane are fully controllable and decoupled with the control approach based on a virtual model. The planar motions on three axes are controlled independently. For the hopping control, the total energy in a hopping cycle on the vertical direction is planned according to the desired hopping height of the torso's CoM and the virtual vertical stiffness of the torso is generated using the elastic potential energy of the virtual model.

   abstract = {This paper carried out a series of designs, simulations and implementations by using the physical-like mechanism of a bionic quadruped robot dog as a vehicle. Through an investigation of the walking mechanisms of quadrupeds, a bionic structure is proposed that is capable of omnidirectional movements and smooth motions. Furthermore, the kinematic and inverse kinematic solutions based on the DH method are explored to lay the foundation for the gait algorithm. Afterward, a classical compound pendulum equation is applied as the foot-end trajectory and inverse kinematic solutions are combined to complete the gait planning. With appropriate foot–ground contact modeling, MATLAB and ADAMS are used to simulate the dynamic behavior and the diagonal trot gait of the quadruped robot. Finally, the physical prototype is constructed, designed and debugged, and its performance is measured through real-world experiments. Results show that the quadruped robot is able to balance itself during trot motion, for both its pitch and roll attitude. The goal of this work is to provide an affordable yet comprehensive platform for novice researchers in the field to study the dynamics, contact modeling, gait planning and attitude control of quadruped robots. © 2021 by the authors.

@article{Raiola2020,
   abstract = {In the context of legged robotics, many criteria based on the control of the Center of Mass (CoM) have been developed to ensure a stable and safe robot locomotion. Defining a whole-body framework with the control of the CoM requires a planning strategy, often based on a specific type of gait and a reliable state-estimation. In a whole-body control approach, if the CoM task is not specified, the consequent redundancy can still be resolved by specifying a postural task that set references for all the joints. Therefore, the postural task can be exploited to keep a well-behaved, stable kinematic configuration. In this work, we propose a generic locomotion framework which is able to generate different kind of gaits, ranging from very dynamic gaits, such as the trot, to more static gaits like the crawl, without the need to plan the CoM trajectory. Consequently, the whole-body controller becomes planner-free and it does not require the estimation of the floating base state, which is often prone to drift. The framework is composed of a priority-based whole-body controller that works in synergy with a walking pattern generator. We show the effectiveness of the framework by presenting simulations on different types of simulated terrains, including rough terrain, using different quadruped platforms.},

@article{Yan2021,
   abstract = {Dynamic locomotion plays a crucial role for legged robots to fulfill tasks in unstructured environments. This paper proposes whole-body kinematic and dynamic modeling method s based on screw theory for a quadruped robot using different gaits and mechanism topologies. Unlike simplified models such as centroid or inverse pendulum models, the methods proposed here can handle 10-dimensional mass and inertia for each part. The only simplification is that foot contact models are treated as spherical joints. Models of three different mechanism topologies are formulated: (1) Standing phase: a system consisting of one end-effector, the body, and four limbs, the legs; (2) Walking phase: a system consisting of one or two lifting legs (depending on the chosen gait), two or three supporting legs; (3) Floating phase: a system in which all legs detach from the ground. Control strategies based on our models are also introduced, which includes walk and trot gait plans. In our control system, two additional types of information are provided: (1) contacting forces are given by force sensors installed under feet; (2) body poses are determined by an inertial measurement unit (IMU). Combined with the sensor data and calibrated mass, inertia, and friction, the joint torque can be estimated accurately in simulation and experiment. Our prototype, the “XiLing” robot, is built to verify the methods proposed in this paper, and the results show that the models can be solved quickly and leads to steady locomotions.},
